# autonumerics_zero

AutoNumerics-Zero, a method to evolve programs that compute transcendental
functions efficientlyâ€”searching from scratch and without knowledge of numerics.

## Usage

Compilation requires Clang.

The package contains an example experiment spec. To test it, run:

```
export CC=clang++
bazel run evolution/projects/graphs/joy:run_worker -- --logtostderr --worker="$(cat evolution/projects/graphs/joy/open_source_num_ops_config.textproto)"
```
